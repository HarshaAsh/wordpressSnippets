Snippets of extra HTML, CSS and Javascript code used in www.harshaash.website.

www.harshaash.website is my personal blog which is maintained through WordPress.
Although the website uses a predefined theme, the theme seems to be insufficient for all the cases that I want to display.
To add extra functionality I have defined a few functions, modified the styling, added HTML and other functionalities.
This repo contains all these additional added codes.

The HTML file, when compiled with the dependent .css and .js files, will create a simple unstructured web page containing all the additions with the functionalities.
It is not advised to do so.
